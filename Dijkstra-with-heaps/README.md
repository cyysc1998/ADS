  This program implement Dijkstra algorithm with Fabinacci heap, Binomial heap and Pairing heap. If you want to run this program, please download the data sets from "http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml". Then unzip the downloaded file, and rename it "map.txt". Put it in the same directory as the executable file.
  Once you're in the program, after loading map, you should input two numbers. The first one is source node. You can input the starting position. The second one is the number of nodes you want to find. For example, if you input 3, 1000, the program will give the nearest 1000 nodes from the node number 3. Then the program will give the runtime of the three types of heap.
